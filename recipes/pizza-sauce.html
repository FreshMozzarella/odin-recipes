        <p>Pizza sauce recipe inspired by Kne Forkish's Flour Salt Water Yeast recipe book</p>
        <p>Key here is to use San Marzano tomatoes (and if you can find calabrian oregano, even better). Make sure to
            have a colander and blender (food processor work very well for this as well)</p>
        <p><strong>Yield: </strong>enough sauce for five 12-inch round thin pizzas</p>

            <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 <span>&#189;</span> tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic (optional)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a colander over a large bowl. Drain the tomatoes for 10 to 15 minutes (<strong>Optional: </strong>
                can also try to use a wooden spoon to repeatedly push the tomatoes back and forth to break them into a
                chunky pulp to drain even more of the juice to have a more chunky texture)</li>
            <li>Put the olive oil, garlic, salt, oregano, and chile flakes in a blender. Add the tomatoes and blend
                until smooth and thoroughly combined</li>
            <li>Refrigerate until the day you bake your pizza</li>
        </ol>
