    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Home-made thin-crust dough that uses long fermentation that develops great flavor the longer you wait. Making these
            dough balls says before allows you to time up baking them the next day at any time. I recommend you buy
            fresh ingredients as well. Check out the <a href="./pizza-sauce.html">Pizza Sauce Recipe</a>. It is a
            game-changer and adds a whole new depth of flavor compared to store-bought sauce</p>
        <p>A baking stone is not required but gives the pizza a more even baking. This dough recipe does not use a
            mixer. I feel this gives one a better opportunity to feel and evaluate when the dough is ready. Having a
            digital thermometer allows us to more accurately measure the rate of fermentation of the dough. Having a
            plastic scraper helps us manipulate the dough as well</p>
        <p>We use instant dry yeast instead of active dry yeast-it gives more efficient rise and has more yeast per
            weight</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/pro/reference/bakers-percentage">here</a> for more information
            about baker's percentage and how to scale recipes</p>
        <p><strong>Yield: </strong>Around five 350 gram dough balls, each of which yield a thin-crust pizza pizza-stone
            about 12 inches in diameter or a thick-crust iron-skillet pizza.<br>
            <strong>Bulk fermentation: </strong>About 12 hours or more<br>
            <strong>Proof time: </strong>At least 6 hours

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hydrate the yeast</strong>-Measure 700 grams of water at 90<span>&#176;</span>F to
                    95<span>&#176;</span>F (32<span>&#176;</span>C to 35<span>&#176;</span>C) into a container. Put 0.8
                    gram of yeast in a separate, small container. Add about 3 tablespoons of the measured water to the
                    yeast and set aside</li>
                <li><strong>Autolyse</strong>-Combine the 1,000 grams of flour with the remaining 700 grams of warm
                    water in a 12-quart round tub(most large containers would suffice).Mix by hand just until
                    incorporated. Cover and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Mix</strong> Sprinkle the 20 grams of salt over the top of the dough.Use a small piece of
                    the autolysed mixture to wipe the remaining yeast from its container, then throw back into tub. Mix
                    by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing the dough doesn't stick to you.(it's fine to
                    re-apply water to hand)Reach underneath the dough and grab a small section. Gently stretch and fold
                    it over the top to the other side of the dough. Repeat three more times with the remaining dough,
                    until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed. Using a pincer-like motion, cut the dough with your
                    thumb and index finger while alternating with folding the dough to fully integrate ingredients. Cut,
                    fold, cut fold, etc. Your target dough temperature should be around 77<span>&#176;</span>F to
                    78<span>&#176;</span>F (25<span>&#176;</span>C to 26 <span>&#176;</span>)</li>
                <li><strong>Fold</strong> This dough needs folding ( <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprDjPWuiN8">visual aid on stretching and
                        folding</a>gently grabbing a corner of the dough, stretching it, and then folding it over the
                    opposite corner as mentioned in previous step) about one or two times. Apply folds 30 to 60 minutes
                    after mixing, giving about 10 to 20 minute breaks in between folds to let the gluten relax. Lightly
                    coat the dough and the bottom of the tub with olive oil to prevent sticking between folds as well.
                    When the dough is 2 to 3 times its original volume (around 12 hours after mixing, it is ready to be
                    divided)</li>
                <li><strong>Divide</strong> Moderately flour a work surface about 2 feet wide. With floured hands,
                    gently ease the dough out of the tub. With your hands still floured, pick up the dough and ease it
                    back down onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape. Dust the entire top of the dough with some
                    flour, then cut into 5 equal-size pieces with a scraper. Each piece should weigh about 340 grams; or
                    you can eyeball it</li>
                <li><strong>Shape the dough into balls</strong> Shape each piece of dough into a medium-tight round,
                    working gently and being careful to not to degas the dough too much(<a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZxNbL5XB7w">visual aid on techniques</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Refrigerate</strong> Put the dough balls on a lightly floured baking sheet, leaving space
                    between them to allow for expansion. Lightly oil or flour the tops, cover with plastic wrap, and
                    refrigerate for at least 6 hours, up to 5 days</li>
                <li><strong>Preheat the pizza stone</strong> About an hour before throwing the pizza in the oven, put
                    your pizza stone or baking sheet on a rack in the upper portion of your oven so the surface is about
                    8 inches below the broiler. Preheat the oven to 600<span>&#176;</span>F (316<span>&#176;</span>C) or
                    preheat to the highest setting you have on the oven, most ovens don't go over 550<span>&#176;</span>F. Once the oven has preheated, continue heating for another 30 to 45 minutes(less time needed if using a metal baking sheet)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Set up your epic pizza assembly station</strong> Give yourself about 2 feet of width on the counter-top. Generously flour the work surface. Position your peel(a cutting board or stiff piece of cardboard also works well as a peel) next to the floured area and dust it with flour. Have sauce, cheese, and basil prepared and at hand, using a ladle or large spoon for the sauce</li>
                <li><strong>Shape your pizza</strong> Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator, put it on the floured work surface, and gently pat it down a bit to coat the bottom with flour. Leaving about 1 inch of the outer rim undeflated, punch down the middle, then flip the dough over and repeat. Using both hands, grab the rim and lift so the dough hangs down vertically. Let gravity pull the rest of the dough down and stretch it. Run the rim between your hands, working all the way around the circumference of the dough several times. Next, make two fists and position them just inside the rim, with the dough still hanging vertically. Gently stretch and turn the dough repeatedly, still letting the bottom of the dough pull down, expanding the surface. Keep a close eye on the thickness of the dough. You want it thin, but you don't want it to tear or develop holes. Don't panic if this happens-patch it over with dough. Spread the dough on the floured(or use semolina flour) peel and run your hands around the perimeter to shape it into a round and work out the kinks </li>
                <li><strong>Superheat the pizza stone</strong> After 30 minutes oven has reached its set temperature, you can switch to broil mode for about 5-10 minutes to get the stone/metal very hot to emulate the heat of a traditional pizza oven</li>
                <li><strong>Top the pizza</strong> Spread with tomato sauce over the dough to within an inch of the edge, smoothing and spreading it with the back of the ladle. Distribute the mozzarella and basil leaves evenly around the pie</li>
                <li><strong>Bake</strong> Turn the oven setting back to bake. With the peel, gently slide the pizza onto the pizza stone/sheet. Bake for 5 minutes, then switch to the broil setting and broil for 2 minutes, keeping a close eye on the pizza. Bake until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is golden with spots of brown and a few spots of char. If the oil separates out of the cheese, it's overbaked. Use tongs or a fork to slide the pizza from the pizza stone/sheet onto a large plate</li>
                <li><strong>Slice and serve</strong> Transfer to a large wooden cutting board. Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil lightly over the top if you like, slice, and serve immediately, passing salt or flakes of your choosing over the table. Optimal time to eat this kind of pizza is when the cheese has been melted, but not to wait too long or it will solidify. Enjoy!</li>
